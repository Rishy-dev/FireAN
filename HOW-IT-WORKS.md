## System

In order for any AI, it needs to be trained under a certain database. Since I am quite lazy, I will be using premade databases.

**Use of Datasets**

Datasets show possible user inputs and the specified outputs for each one of them. This let's the AI "learn" on what results it should give, what type of inputs it will get, and finally making it's own outputs based on the dataset and the input from the user.

**How it "learns"**

This proccess of an AI learning is called MACHINE LEARNING. The name implies literally what is is used for. The machine simply "learns". In this case, this machine is AI. There are simple machine learning tools like [https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com], or [https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk]. Then, there are more complicated ones like TenserFlow, or Pandas. Either way, the result you get is similar.
